In the convergence study of the quantum Lyapunov control, two situations are classified: nondegenerate cases and degenerate cases. For these two situations, respectively, in this paper the target state is divided into four categories: the eigenstate, the mixed state which commutes with the internal Hamiltonian, the superposition state, and the mixed state which does not commute with the internal Hamiltonian. For these four categories, the quantum Lyapunov control methods for the closed quantum systems are summarized and analyzed. Particularly, the convergence of the control system to the different target states is reviewed, and how to make the convergence conditions be satisfied is summarized and analyzed.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY In this paper, the state convergence problem for closed quantum systems is investigated. We consider two degenerate cases, where the internal Hamiltonian of the system is not strongly regular or the linearized system around the target state is not controllable. Both the cases are closely related to practical systems such as one-dimensional oscillators and coupled two spin systems. An implicit Lyapunov-based control strategy is adopted for the convergence analysis. In particular, two kinds of Lyapunov functions are defined by implicit functions and their existences are guaranteed by a fixed point theorem. The convergence analysis is investigated by the LaSalle invariance principle for both cases. Moreover, the two Lyapunov functions are unified in a general form, and the characterization of the largest invariant set is presented. Finally, simulation studies are included to show the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed methods. Copyright {\copyright} 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

@article{NikNatComm,
	abstract = {Ising spin Hamiltonians are often used to encode a computational problem in their ground states. Quantum Annealing (QA) computing searches for such a state by implementing a slow time-dependent evolution from an easy-to-prepare initial state to a low energy state of a target Ising Hamiltonian of quantum spins, HI. Here, we point to the existence of an analytical solution for such a problem for an arbitrary HI beyond the adiabatic limit for QA. This solution provides insights into the accuracy of nonadiabatic computations. Our QA protocol in the pseudo-adiabatic regime leads to a monotonic power-law suppression of nonadiabatic excitations with time T of QA, without any signature of a transition to a glass phase, which is usually characterized by a logarithmic energy relaxation. This behavior suggests that the energy relaxation can differ in classical and quantum spin glasses strongly, when it is assisted by external time-dependent fields. In specific cases of HI, the solution also shows a considerable quantum speedup in computations.},
